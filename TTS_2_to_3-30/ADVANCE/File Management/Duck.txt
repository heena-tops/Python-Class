Returns an exception group. that contains only the exceptions from the current group that match condition, or None if the result is empty.

The condition can be either a function that accepts an exception and returns true for those that should be in the subgroup, or it can be an exception type or a tuple of exception types, which is used to check for a match using the same check that is used in an except clause.

The nesting structure of the current exception is preserved in the result, as are the values of its message, __traceback__, __cause__, __context__ and __notes__ fields. Empty nested groups are omitted from the result.

The condition is checked for all exceptions in the nested exception group, including the top-level and any nested exception groups. If the condition is true for such an exception group, it is included in the result in full.
